<h2 id='Merge'>Merge</h2>

Merge two or more PDFs into one.
<!--
If a non-PDF file type supported by <a href='Convert.html'>Convert</a>
is given, it is spontaneously converted to PDF and merged.
-->

<p>Preserves named destinations, outlines, and interactive forms.
If named destinations conflict,
as when a PDF generator automatically generates generic names like "page.1" or "section.8",
they are renamed.


<h3>Options</h3>

<blockquote><code>java tool.pdf.<b>M</b>erge <i>[options]</i> <var>PDF-filename</var> <var>PDF-filename...</var></code></blockquote>

<ul class='options'>
<li id='append'><span class='opt'>-append</span> -- append onto existing first file (else create new PDF).
Files merged with this option can be unmerged with <a href='Undo.html'>Undo</a>.

<li id='samedoc'><span class='opt'>-samedoc</span> -- declare that the PDFs to be merged should be considered a single document,
as opposed to different documents collected into the same file.
With this flag, bookmarks that refer to the same name are not considered conflicts,
and outlines are lifted up one level to be at the same level across merged files.
(Inspired by Steven Skoczen.)

<li id='password'><span class='opt'>-password <var>password</var></span> -- password if PDF is encrypted.
All documents to merge must have this password or no password.
<!--li><span class='opt'>-out <var>file</var></span> -- name of merged file.  Default: <code>merge.pdf</code>-->
</ul>

In the absence of <span class='opt'>-append</span>,
the merged version of the PDFs is named with <code>-m</code> appended to the first file name.

Supply the owner password to decrypt PDFs with standard security, 40-bit or 128-bit keys.
This does not decrypt Adobe eBooks, which use a different encryption mechanism.

<blockquote><code>java tool.pdf.<b>D</b>ecrypt <i>[options]</i> <var>PDF files or directories</var></code></blockquote>

<ul class='options'>
<li id='password'><span class='opt'>-password <var>password</var></span> -- 
<em>owner</em> password.
The null password is tried automatically.
The password is checked for validity before applying it to the document content.

<li id='inplace'><span class='opt'>-inplace</span> -- write decrypted PDF over existing

<li id='out'><span class='opt'>-out[file]</span> -- in absence of 
<span class='opt'>-inplace</span> 
filename to use for decrypted PDF (default: <tt><var>name</var>-d.pdf</tt>)
</ul>


<h3 id='faq'>FAQ</h3>

<p>Why is the OWNER password required to decrypt when I can I don't need a password to view the PDF?

<p>In this case the user password is null, allowing access to the document according to the author permissions.
Changing the author permissions -- which in any reasonable interpretation includes removing encryption! --
requires the author password.
Here is a quote from the Adobe's PDF Reference, fifth edition:

<blockquote>
1.5 Intellectual Property
<p>The general idea of using an interchange format for electronic documents is in
the public domain. Anyone is free to devise a set of unique data structures and
operators that define an interchange format for electronic documents. However,
Adobe Systems Incorporated owns the copyright for the particular data structures
and operators and the written specification constituting the interchange format
called the Portable Document Format. Thus, these elements of the Portable
Document Format may not be copied without Adobe's permission.

<p>...

<p>The conditions of such copyright permission are:<br />
&bull; Authors of software that accepts input in the form of the Portable Document
Format must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the software they create respects
the access permissions and permissions controls listed in Table 3.20 of
this specification, to the extent that they are used in any particular document.
These access permissions express the rights that the documents author has
granted to users of the document. It is the responsibility of Portable Document
Format consumer software to respect the authors intent.

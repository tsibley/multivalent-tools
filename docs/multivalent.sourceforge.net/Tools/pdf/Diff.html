<h2 id='Diff'>Structural Differences</h2>

Compare two PDFs and report <em>structural</em> differences.
Two PDFs that are structurally identical should render the same,
but may differ in the exact objects and whether they are inlined or referenced with an indirect reference.
<code>Diff</code> can be used after some transformation,
such as compression or encryption, 
to verify that the PDF has not been otherwise modified.


<h3>Options</h3>

<blockquote><code>java tool.pdf.Diff <i>[options]</i> <var>PDF-filename</var></code></blockquote>

<ul class='options'>
<li id='ignoredates'><span class='opt'>-ignoredates</span> --
<!--
<li id='root'><span class='opt'>-root</span> -- often an object will not match only because it relies on another object that not match.
This option ignores secondary differences and reports only the root objects.
=> report some difference but doesn't try to match as many objects as possible anymore because that's too slow
-->
<li id='password1'><span class='opt'>-password1 <var>password</var></span> and 
<span class='opt'>-password2 <var>password</var></span> -- password for first and second PDF, respectively
<li id='page1'><span class='opt'>-page1 <a href='http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/Tools/HowToRun.html#range'><var>range</var></a></span>
and <span class='opt'>-page2 <a href='http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/Tools/HowToRun.html#range'><var>range</var></a></span> -- 
password for first and second PDF, respectively.
If one range is missing, it is set to the other range.
If both ranges are set, they must have the same number of pages.
If ranges are set, then those pages are compared only; no other information in the PDFs are affect equality determination.
</ul>

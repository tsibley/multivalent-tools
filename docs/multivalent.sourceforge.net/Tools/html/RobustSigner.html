<!--
<p>URLs can be made robust so that if a web page moves to another
location anywhere on the web, you can find it.  Even if that page has
been edited.  (If the page has been deleted, and no mirrors are
available, you'll have to try something else, obviously.)  Today's
address-based URLs are augmented with a five or so word content-based
<i>lexical signature</i> to make a <b>Robust Hyperlink</b>.  When the
URL's address-based portion breaks, the signature is fed into any web
search engine to find the new site of the page.  Although web browser
support is desirable for complete convenience, Robust Hyperlinks work
<i>now</i>, as drop-in replacements of URLs in <i>today</i>'s HTML,
web browsers, web servers and search engines.  See the <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~phelps/Robust/" TARGET="INFO">Robust
Web Site</a> for complete details.

<!-- later (server better but not happening)
<p>This free, Open Source software can rewrite your web pages and
bookmarks files to make them robust, automatically.  URLs within
HTML's A HREF and other tags are augmented with the lexical signature
and all other text is left untouched.  (This software can be run as a
text-based application by suppling the option -textmode on startup.)

<h2 id='Robust'>Robust Hyperlink Signer</h2>

Automatically rewrite HTML pages to make their hyperlinks robust.
Recurses directories and rewrites links in files named ".html" and ".htm"
to make their links robust.
The page rewriting only touches links &mdash; all other text is left untouched.
See <a href='http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~phelps/Robust/'>Robust Hyperlinks</a> web site for details.

<h3>Options</h3>

<blockquote><code>java tool.html.Robust <i>[options]</i> <var>URL</var> [<var>filename</var>]</code></blockquote>

<ul class='options'>
<!--li><span class='opt'>-siglen <var>number</var></span> -- 
number of words in signature -->
<li><var>URL</var> is taken as the base URL
</ul>

<!--
<var>URL</var> gives the HTTP URL corresponding to <filename>, and it
used to resolve links relative to the local site root (as in
"http:/images/img.png").  If the HTML contains no such links, as in a
bookmarks file, <var>URL</var> may be omitted, but do so at your own risk.  If
you'd like, you can make a copy or revision control checkpoint of the
file/directory tree first.

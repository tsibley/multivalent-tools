[Multivalent][] is a old, well-proven, and free tool that I've used for PDF
operations many times before over the years.  It makes imposition easy, for
example.

Last time I tried to find the jar itself and the associated documentation, I
found that they were removed or obfuscated from current versions of Multivalent
and its website.ยน  After some digging, I found vintage copies as I remembered
them existing.  Those are archived here.  As best I can tell, the vintage
copies were originally released under the GPL.

You can also browse the Internet Archives' Wayback Machine to see the
[Multivalent website and tool doc at the time][wayback].
